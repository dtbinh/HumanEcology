This is the AIMS@UNM Supercomputing project for 2012-13.
It is a StarLogo model of human ecology in cities, and is still undergoing heavy modification.
More information is available on github.com/nightcaptain/HumanEcology, our information tab in the program, and our interim report at http://mode.lanl.k12.nm.us/get_interim1213.php?team_id=3.

  ** Top-priority items **
     - Set scale of pixels to physical meters and dial back agent speed as necessary
