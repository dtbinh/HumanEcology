This is the AIMS@UNM Supercomputing project for 2012-13.
It is a StarLogo model of human ecology in cities, and is still undergoing heavy modification.
More information is available on github.com/nightcaptain/HumanEcology, our information tab in the program, and our interim report at http://mode.lanl.k12.nm.us/get_interim1213.php?team_id=3.

  ** Top-priority items **
     - Replace volume with weight when working with gathered food
     - Move from faster model to slower + more accurate model
          - Adjust minute timescale
          - Adjust patch size?
     - Fix the behavior-bug, then re-add the regrowth of food
     - Reproduction and death

  ** Do when able **
     - Delete missed comments; unused variables; useless functions;; splitscreen remnants
     - Change patch colors of road to roadlike colours
     - Add on/off switches for plotting agent classes
     - Reorganize the graphs and sliders to be more easily readable. 
     
  ** Future ideas **
     - Creation of other settlements/cities
     - Energy cost of harvesting
     - Technological evolution over time
     - Side-by-side comparison of a rural-starting v. industrial-starting society
